WELCOME TO MY PROJECT!!

This is a very basic app made using MERN stack that can be used to post, update, delete and view memes. Do try it out!!

The steps are pretty simple. To use it locally, clone this repo and cd into the directory created and run test_server.sh to test the backend.
you can also make changes to the frontend if you want to and then cd into frontend and use npm install and npm start to see the changes made locally .
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKEND RUNNING LOCALLY BEFORE YOU CHECK THE FRONTEND.
Additionally, you can use these sites :- https://memesrver.netlify.app(for frontend UI) and :- https://mymemeserver.herokuapp.com(for backend) for a more visual experience.
